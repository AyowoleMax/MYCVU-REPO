# MYCVU-REPO
Open and Reproducible Research Computing
## Bio :man_student:
**Hello, Everyone!** :wave:

My name is Ayowole Fifo, and I am a first-year masterâ€™s student at the University of Nevada, Reno. I will be researching lake diatoms and paleolimnology; how diatoms can help access the history of lakes, including reconstructing past climates and environmental conditions. I enrolled on this course because I believe it will provide me with knowledge on how to analyze datasets using computational tools, which I can apply to my research. I am currently at the beginner level of Python, R programming learning and, of course, Git. I am interested in collaborations on projects relating to limnology, hydrology and other fields of geology. My hobbies include listening to music and playing football at weekends.
## Goals :writing_hand:
My goals at the end of the module are:  
- To be confident in my ability to use a version control system such as Git to track, organize, and document my projects.

- To contribute to open and reproducible research by working with colleagues to develop reusable hydrologic datasets.

- To obtain a grasp of how computational tools can be used to create hydrologic models to provide answers to water-related challenges.

- To gain proficiency in evaluating spatial and temporal data related to hydrologic system studies.
